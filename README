jslint is a standalone unix command line utility powered by Douglas Crowdford's 
javascript jslint.js (http://www.jslint.com) & Google's v8 engine. It is a 
javascript code quality tool (Warning: JSLint will hurt your feelings)

It will currently hurt yours feelings even more, as the current jslint settings
are hard coded to "the good parts", which are best sum up by the following JSON 
jslint.js config string, you might be already familiar with:
{white: true, onevar: true, undef: true, nomen: true, eqeqeq: true, 
plusplus: true, bitwise: true, regexp: true, newcap: true, immed: true, 
strict: true}

In order to download & build properly jslint you will need to make sure you have
installed all of Google's v8 dependencies, if you are unsure please visit:
